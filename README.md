# Data-Analysis-on-Olympics-Data
This file contains interesting findings and visualizations on Olympics Data. 
I was reading an article(https://nuunlife.com/blogs/news/a-timeline-of-women-in-the-olympics)
Women in Olympics and there were so many fun facts that the author shared.
I was very much intrigued by the study and wanted to do analysis on the Olympics data myself. 
Also, I have always been interested in sports, thus, it was so much fun to treat the data and find patterns and anomalies.
